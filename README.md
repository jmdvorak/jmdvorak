### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### My name is John Dvorak. Previously, I was a Civil Engineer working on developing Amazon Distribution Centers. Since then I have changed gears. I am just completing my Master's of Data Science at Northwestern. I'm looking for work currently, but developing my skills in areas like Git, Github, and projects solving real world problems to help stand out more. I am currently learning the ins and outs of GitHub so I can start uploading projects I have done and ones I will most likely look for guidance on. I have interests in predicting sporting event outcomes using machine learning models for NFL, NCAAF, and NCAAB. My career focus right now is developing at a large company with a data scientist department so I can get proper training as I progress. Ask me about anything, I am an open book to a fault. Hello to everybody reading this!
